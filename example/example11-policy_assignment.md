# Policy Assignment

Policies may be assigned in various ways to support the flexibility required by your particular implementation of Vault.

This example will focus on assigning policies to Users/Roles, Identity Entities, and Identity Groups.

For information regarding assigning policies to Tokens see the Tokens [documentation](https://developer.hashicorp.com/vault/docs/auth/token) and [API](https://developer.hashicorp.com/vault/api-docs/auth/token#create-token) guide.
